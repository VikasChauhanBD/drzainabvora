I have never admired a teacher the way I admire you, ma'am. Before subscribing to BTR, I honestly didn't even know how to begin INICET preparation.

You put in so much effort from going through all the Telegram doubts to clearing them the very next day in your live sessions. The BTRs, TNDs, mega revisions, Ashirwad classes everything was amazing. You truly are the best teacher and mentor one could ever ask for. Honestly I thought I'd have to take a drop after internship. But when the NEET postponement was announced, I decided to give it my all and started watching your videos religiously and I secured a decent rank of 7.2k.

I felt content, relieved, and proud of how far I had come. I honestly thought that was the end of my journey-that I had reached my limit. But then you said something that changed everything. You told all of us to take the INI-CET November attempt... to not settle... to give ourselves the chance to enter a central institute. At that moment, your confidence in us was stronger than our own. And that one message from you lit a spark in me that I didn't even realize was still there. Because of your belief, I decided to attempt INI-CET November. And today, with overwhelming happiness, I can say that I secured Rank 29. I'm going to pursue my dream branch in a central institute-something that once felt far away, but became possible because you pushed me to try one more time.",

        "BTR helped me immensely, no doubt about that. Coming from a private medical college, I had no proper guidance on how to clear NEET or INI, and cracking both in the first attempt felt almost impossible where I come from. BTR helped me consolidate my preparation and gave me a clear direction. My rank may not be a topper's rank, but I'm getting the branch I wanted through NEET, and that is entirely because of Dr. Zainab Vora ma'am. I'm truly grateful to her for her constant support and guidance.",

Also its concise and if u read it right , u will understand how everything is covered in just 2 books and how beautifully everything is interconnected . Test and discussions are just top notch , it actually makes u think out of the box and integrate subjects together and then arrive at the answer . Though it's not a great rank that would get me a seat of choice ,  it's definitely given me the confidence to prepare for the next exam to come.",

Along with a few BTR tests and live discussions, that was all I did. Zainab ma'am made me believe that even a not-so-motivated post-NEET student who doesn't want to give up still has a chance. Revising all subjects in just 4 days felt impossible on my own, but she made it happen. What sets BTR apart is not just the concise content, but the structured plan and constant hand-holding through live sessions till the ashirwaad class, ensuring we stay on track. Thank you, ma'am, for creating BTR and making preparation easier ❤️.",
