        "BTR helped me immensely, no doubt about that. Coming from a private medical college, I had no proper guidance on how to clear NEET or INI, and cracking both in the first attempt felt almost impossible where I come from. BTR helped me consolidate my preparation and gave me a clear direction. My rank may not be a topper's rank, but I'm getting the branch I wanted through NEET, and that is entirely because of Dr. Zainab Vora ma'am. I'm truly grateful to her for her constant support and guidance.",

        "BTR helped me learn how to approach the question and analyse . Also its concise and if u read it right , u will understand how everything is covered in just 2 books and how beautifully everything is interconnected . Test and discussions are just top notch , it actually makes u think out of the box and integrate subjects together and then arrive at the answer . Though it's not a great rank that would get me a seat of choice ,  it's definitely given me the confidence to prepare for the next exam to come.",

Along with a few BTR tests and live discussions, that was all I did. Zainab ma'am made me believe that even a not-so-motivated post-NEET student who doesn't want to give up still has a chance. Revising all subjects in just 4 days felt impossible on my own, but she made it happen. What sets BTR apart is not just the concise content, but the structured plan and constant hand-holding through live sessions till the ashirwaad class, ensuring we stay on track. Thank you, ma'am, for creating BTR and making preparation easier ❤️.",
