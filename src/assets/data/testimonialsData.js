I have never admired a teacher the way I admire you, ma'am. Before subscribing to BTR, I honestly didn't even know how to begin INICET preparation.

You put in so much effort from going through all the Telegram doubts to clearing them the very next day in your live sessions. The BTRs, TNDs, mega revisions, Ashirwad classes everything was amazing. You truly are the best teacher and mentor one could ever ask for. Honestly I thought I'd have to take a drop after internship. But when the NEET postponement was announced, I decided to give it my all and started watching your videos religiously and I secured a decent rank of 7.2k.

I felt content, relieved, and proud of how far I had come. I honestly thought that was the end of my journey-that I had reached my limit. But then you said something that changed everything. You told all of us to take the INI-CET November attempt... to not settle... to give ourselves the chance to enter a central institute. At that moment, your confidence in us was stronger than our own. And that one message from you lit a spark in me that I didn't even realize was still there. Because of your belief, I decided to attempt INI-CET November. And today, with overwhelming happiness, I can say that I secured Rank 29. I'm going to pursue my dream branch in a central institute-something that once felt far away, but became possible because you pushed me to try one more time.",

I used to look at the quote on my chhoti copy - at any moment you have the power to say this is not how my story will end and I now think it made me believe that I can do it and I did. Thankyou for giving me that courage to believe. This could have never been possible without you.",

You really kept me going even when I didn't know if I could. The little jokes between your videos were the best part of my prep journey, you have been my biggest inspiration in every which way possible and I feel so lucky to have met you at the 4 day offline BTR Chennai. I hope and wish to get to meet you again! Thankyou for everything.",

        "Firstly big big fan!! I mean for real. I wouldn't die to meet any Bollywood actors also this much that I would die to meet you. Got AIR 5700 ma'am, All thanks to YOU and only YOU ma'am. I came across BTR for the first time last year in the month of April and gave May INI. I hardly had done few subjects back then but right after that exam is when I realized what a gem BTR is and how well you taught us. Honestly I feel, I didn't even know this is how we study to retain for long term or the fact that everything can be integrated this well. Got a rank of 30k in 2024 and this was with 3 months of preparation. I honestly think if I had not come across your teaching, I clearly couldn't have cracked this exam. Cause you made it so interesting and so good. I couldn't go a day without listening to your voice. I'm just so so grateful for you ma'am!!",

I am forever grateful to you ma'am. I hope to meet you next year with a better rank and a dream seat in my hand. Thank you for being the wonderful person you are and the hard work you have put in BTR that numerous students have benefitted from.",

        "Thank you so much Dr. Zainab Vora ma'am for everything you do. My PG preparation journey has finally come to an end, and I just wanted to say how grateful I am to you! You put in so much effort from going through all the Telegram doubts to clearing them the very next day in your live sessions. The BTRs, TNDs, mega revisions, Ashirwad classes everything was amazing. You truly are the best teacher and mentor one could ever ask for. Honestly I thought I'd have to take a drop after internship. But when the NEET postponement was announced, I decided to give it my all and started watching your videos religiously and I secured a decent rank of 7.2k. Thank you so much ma'am I couldn't have done this without you. I was literally crying while watching the mega session just seeing the kind of effort you put in moved me so much. You're the kindest, smartest, and most inspiring person ever! I'm totally in awe of you.",

I was generally an ambitious person from the start and you were the perfect teacher for me ma'am. I'd always say I wanna aim for the stars so that if I can't reach them I'd at least fall on the moon and I think you just fueled the fire inside me, while also keeping me grounded and not letting me lose sight of what we're actually working for. We're not in this to get a rank we're all in this to get a seat for the specialty we wanna practice our whole life. I think younger me would have wanted to give it one more try for rank 1 but I've changed in these three months and I'm grateful and content with what I've got and I think I'll leave this rat race here. Ma'am you've made me a better doctor and a better person. I've learnt patience, unconditional love, resilience, gratitude and many more things which I can't find words for.",

I felt content, relieved, and proud of how far I had come. I honestly thought that was the end of my journey-that I had reached my limit. But then you said something that changed everything. You told all of us to take the INI-CET November attempt... to not settle... to give ourselves the chance to enter a central institute. At that moment, your confidence in us was stronger than our own. And that one message from you lit a spark in me that I didn't even realize was still there. Because of your belief, I decided to attempt INI-CET November. And today, with overwhelming happiness, I can say that I secured Rank 29. I'm going to pursue my dream branch in a central institute-something that once felt far away, but became possible because you pushed me to try one more time.",

I secured a rank of 8261, and while I understand my performance could have been better compared to my GT scores, I am truly grateful for your teaching. Your END modules helped me tremendously, and I relied almost entirely on BTR along with a few of my own Step 2 notes. It really would not have been possible without your clarity and structured approach. I'm so glad I chose to stay consistent with BTR instead of running after multiple resources. Thank you once again for making such a big difference in this journey.",

        "Thank you Dr. Zainab Vora ma'am, You made this infinite syllabus feel coverable in a finite number of days, and for that I am eternally grateful. I may be an atheist, but I have religiously followed you through every video, every class, and every E&D session. Because of that, I was able to achieve Rank 708 From 22k in NEET PG 2024, to 4.5k in INI May 2025, to finally 708 in NEET PG 2025 it has been a long, exhausting, and sometimes lonely journey. But you made it bearable. Your witty humor, your relatable references 'Are yaar, ma'am ne How I Met Your Mother bhi dekha hai, Friends bhi dekha hai, Big Bang Theory bhi dekha hai' they gave me a strange sense of belonging in this otherwise harsh and lonely path. This rank is as much yours as it is mine. I always dreamt of taking Radiology, and in you I found not just a teacher but an idol.",

After getting 21k rank last year I was completely clueless about what, how to do and many such questions were in my mind but that all ended on 26th august when I heard you in strategy session and all my questions and self doubt disappeared. BTR became my main source and added stuffs in it. Taking baby steps I got AIR 1400 in INI NOV 24 and AIR 1082 in INI MAY 25 and finally AIR 748 in NEET PG 25. Your constant encouragement, clarity in instructions and timely advice helped me each day each minute.

After that I was working full-time due to financial reasons and wasn't able to study much, so got a rank of 12.8k in INI CET which really disheartened me. I didn't have any hope for NEET PG which was supposed to be held in June. But then the news of postponement came and your words echoed in my head. You said the postponement is for ME, to re-write my story and I took it to heart. I went from full-time work to part-time work and studied with a schedule and a plan.

        "I hadn't studied much after NEET as I was preparing for admission, but the 4-day offline BTR helped me revise the entire syllabus once again. Along with a few BTR tests and live discussions, that was all I did. Zainab ma'am made me believe that even a not-so-motivated post-NEET student who doesn't want to give up still has a chance. Revising all subjects in just 4 days felt impossible on my own, but she made it happen. What sets BTR apart is not just the concise content, but the structured plan and constant hand-holding through live sessions till the ashirwaad class, ensuring we stay on track. Thank you, ma'am, for creating BTR and making preparation easier ❤️.",

BTR was the ultimate structure and organization that i lacked throughout my previous attempts. It has been an honour to be your student for last 1 year. I don't know if my rank is good enough to really make you proud.

I also wish my paternal grandmom was here at home to know my result at 89yrs she was always supporting me emotionally and now she is in ICU since 2days with brain stroke. She knows u too ma'am! She used to see you in our live classes and would be so happy that I am studying! Thank you so much ma'am Thank you for creating this beautiful BTR Family.",

Cracking NEET PG in my first attempt, alongside internship and that too from a private university, would never have been possible without your constant guidance. From the very beginning, I had little faith in myself but immense faith in you. After NEET UG, I always carried this fire to prove something in life and I knew this was my chance. You literally spoon-fed me the way to study, your timetables, your methods, BTR and T&Ds... and I just did exactly what you said. The postponement turned out to be a blessing too - it helped me push from 145+ corrects to 160 corrects. And that wouldn't have happened without your system and mentorship.

I honestly had started studying in April this year. I was in total anxiety. My INI CET rank was very bad but your lectures kept me motivated and not give up to the last minute. You're an Angel. Whatever I get, I'll be forever grateful to have learned from you! Not just studies but life in general! People with a pure heart like you are rare to find.",

I've relied on BTR only as main source and if anyone says BTR is not enough I will just say BTR is as good as you are. It's the crux of the story what you've created is a Zainab verse of your own with everything coming together beautifully in the end. At first IMBJ is just an annoying four letter word in the end it becomes the meeting point of so many subjects. Ma'am really you are an artist if there is anyone who has prepared for this entrance to the top notch level it's you and you do it every year. There are many sources of preparation but there is only one mentor who is there from strategy class till ashirvaad class. Thank you for being part of my journey.",
