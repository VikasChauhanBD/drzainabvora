              There are topics students read repeatedly and still struggle to
              grasp. BTR approaches them differently—by cutting through
              unnecessary layers and focusing on what truly matters.

              With Dr. Zainab’s teaching, concepts often click sooner than
              expected. Her summaries and flowcharts are designed for clarity
              and recall.

              As exams approach, mental fatigue sets in and attention becomes
              limited. During this phase, students need material that supports
              recall—not overload.

              Instead of lengthy theory, BTR focuses on:

              Teaching that understands student pressure
            </h3>
            <p className="feature-text">
              One thing becomes clear early on: the teaching does not feel
              distant. It reflects an understanding of the stress, self-doubt,
              and exhaus on students experience.
            </p>
            <p className="feature-text">
              Guidance is practical, firm when needed, and reassuring when
